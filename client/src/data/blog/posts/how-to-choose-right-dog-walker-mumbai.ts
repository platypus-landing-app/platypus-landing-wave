Finding the right dog walker in Mumbai is one of the most important decisions you'll make as a pet parent. Your dog's safety, happiness, and well-being depend on the person you trust with their daily walks. With the growing number of dog walking services in Mumbai, here's a comprehensive guide to help you make an informed choice.

## Look for Proper Certification and Training

A professional dog walker should have formal training in canine behavior, first aid, and breed-specific handling. Certification shows that the walker has invested time in understanding how dogs communicate, what stresses them, and how to respond in emergencies. Ask any potential dog walker about their training background. If they can't provide clear answers, that's a sign to keep looking.

Beyond basic handling, trained walkers understand leash techniques, recall commands, and how to manage dogs of varying temperaments. This knowledge is especially critical in a busy city like Mumbai, where walks often involve navigating traffic, crowds, and unpredictable street animals.

## Insist on GPS Tracking and Real-Time Updates

Technology has made it possible for pet parents to monitor their dog's walk in real time. A reliable dog walking service should offer GPS tracking so you can see exactly where your dog is at any moment. Live tracking isn't just a convenience—it's a safety feature. If something goes wrong, you'll know your dog's precise location instantly.

Look for services that also provide post-walk reports, including route maps, duration, and any observations about your dog's behavior or health during the walk.

## Evaluate Safety Protocols

Safety should never be an afterthought. Ask prospective dog walkers about their protocols for emergencies—what happens if your dog slips its leash, encounters an aggressive stray, or shows signs of heatstroke? A professional walker will have clear, practiced responses to all of these scenarios.

Also check whether the service conducts background verification on its walkers and carries insurance. In a city as dynamic as Mumbai, these precautions are non-negotiable.

## Assess Breed Knowledge and Temperament Matching

Not all dogs are the same. A Labrador's exercise needs differ vastly from those of a Shih Tzu or an Indian Spitz. The right dog walker should understand breed-specific requirements—how far different breeds should walk, what pace suits them, and which environments they thrive in.

Equally important is temperament matching. A high-energy dog might need a walker who keeps a brisk pace with plenty of stimulation, while a senior dog benefits from slower, gentler outings. Ask how the service matches walkers to dogs.

## Watch Out for Red Flags

Steer clear of dog walkers who handle too many dogs at once, refuse to share their background, or can't explain their approach to emergencies. Other warning signs include inconsistent scheduling, lack of communication after walks, and unwillingness to meet your dog for a trial session before committing. A trustworthy dog walker will always welcome your questions and be transparent about their methods.
