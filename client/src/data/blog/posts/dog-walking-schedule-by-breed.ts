One of the most common questions dog parents ask is, "How much should I walk my dog?" The answer depends heavily on breed, age, and individual temperament. A walking schedule that keeps a Labrador happy would exhaust a Bulldog, and what satisfies a Shih Tzu would barely warm up a German Shepherd. Here is a practical guide to help you build the right routine.

## High-Energy Breeds: Built to Move

Breeds like Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, Border Collies, and Dalmatians were originally bred for demanding physical work. These dogs thrive on 60 to 90 minutes of walking per day, ideally split across two sessions. A brisk morning walk and a longer evening outing with opportunities to explore and sniff works well. Without adequate exercise, high-energy breeds often develop destructive behaviors—chewing furniture, digging, or incessant barking—not out of defiance, but out of sheer pent-up energy.

## Moderate-Energy Breeds: The Balanced Middle

Beagles, Cocker Spaniels, Poodles, and Boxers fall into the moderate category. They enjoy activity but do not demand marathon sessions. Around 40 to 60 minutes of daily walking, split into one or two outings, keeps them physically fit and mentally engaged. These breeds benefit particularly from walks that include variety—different routes, new parks, and opportunities to encounter fresh scents. Monotony bores them faster than a lack of distance.

## Low-Energy Breeds: Quality Over Quantity

Bulldogs, Shih Tzus, Pugs, Basset Hounds, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are content with shorter, gentler walks. Twenty to 30 minutes per day is usually sufficient, and it is important not to push these breeds beyond their comfort. Many of them are brachycephalic—having shortened snouts that make breathing harder during exertion, especially in warm weather. For these dogs, a relaxed stroll with plenty of sniffing time is far more beneficial than a fast-paced march.

## Indian Breeds: The Often Overlooked Athletes

Indian breeds like the Indie (Indian Pariah Dog) and the Mudhol Hound are remarkably athletic and adaptable. Indies are natural explorers with excellent stamina, thriving on 45 to 60 minutes of daily walking that includes sensory-rich environments. Mudhol Hounds, originally bred for hunting, need even more—60 to 90 minutes with space to stretch into a trot or run. These breeds are common across Indian cities and deserve walking schedules that respect their heritage and energy levels, not the minimal outings they are often given.

## Puppies vs. Senior Dogs

Age matters as much as breed. Puppies have bursts of energy but tire quickly, and their developing joints cannot handle long walks. A safe guideline is five minutes of walking per month of age, twice a day—so a four-month-old puppy gets two 20-minute walks. Senior dogs, regardless of breed, often need shorter and slower walks with more frequent rest breaks. Watch for signs of fatigue like heavy panting, lagging behind, or reluctance to continue, and adjust accordingly.

## Platypus Breed-Appropriate Walk Plans

At **Platypus**, we do not believe in one-size-fits-all walks. When you sign up, we assess your dog's breed, age, energy level, and health to create a customized walking plan. A young Labrador gets a vigorous, exploration-heavy session. A senior Pug gets a gentle, paced stroll with plenty of shade. Our Guardians are trained to adapt in real time—shortening a walk if a dog shows fatigue or extending it when energy levels are high. Because the best walking schedule is not just about how long you walk, but how well the walk matches your dog's unique needs.
