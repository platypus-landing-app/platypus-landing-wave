The Indian Pariah Dog — commonly called the Indie — is not a breed that was designed by humans. They are a landrace, shaped by thousands of years of natural selection across the Indian subcontinent. No human breeder decided what they should look like, how big they should be, or what job they should do. Evolution did that work, and the result is one of the healthiest, most genetically sound, and most climate-adapted dogs on the planet.

Indies are increasingly being adopted in Mumbai, and that is a genuinely positive trend. But adoption often comes with a misconception: that because Indies lived on streets, they are "easy" dogs who need minimal exercise and enrichment. The opposite is true. A street dog survives by being alert, active, resourceful, and constantly engaged with their environment. Take that dog into an apartment and give them nothing to do, and you will see the same frustration and behavioural problems that appear in any under-exercised working breed.

## How Much Walking Does an Indie Dog Need?

An adult Indie needs **45 to 75 minutes of walking per day**, depending on their individual energy level and age. Unlike standardised breeds where exercise needs are fairly predictable, Indies show significant individual variation because they are not bred to a single template. Some are calm and moderate; others are high-energy athletes. Observe your specific dog and adjust accordingly.

A good starting structure is a 20 to 30 minute morning walk and a 30 to 45 minute evening walk. Indies are crepuscular by nature — most active during dawn and dusk — so scheduling walks at these times aligns with their biological rhythms.

**Mental stimulation is where Indies truly shine.** They are exceptionally intelligent and observant dogs, often compared to Border Collies in their problem-solving ability. Walks should include environmental enrichment: varied routes, exposure to new stimuli, opportunities to investigate and make decisions. An Indie walked on the same route every day at the same pace will become bored far faster than you might expect.

Incorporate scent work, training cues during walks, and controlled socialisation with other dogs. Indies are naturally social animals (they evolved in loosely structured packs), and positive interactions with other dogs during walks contribute significantly to their well-being.

**Adopted puppies** vary widely in their exercise readiness depending on their background. A puppy rescued young and socialised early may be ready for regular walks by three to four months. A puppy rescued later may need gradual leash training before walks become productive. Follow the five-minutes-per-month-of-age guideline as a starting point and adjust based on your puppy's comfort and confidence.

**Senior Indies** remain remarkably active compared to senior dogs of many pedigree breeds. An Indie at ten years old may still enjoy 30 to 45 minutes of daily walking. Their genetic robustness means they typically have fewer age-related mobility issues, though you should still watch for slowing pace and joint stiffness.

## Best Walking Conditions for Indies in Mumbai

This is where the Indie has an unmatched advantage over every imported breed on this list. **Indies are naturally adapted to India's climate.** Their single coat, lean body, large ears (which radiate heat efficiently), and long muzzle (which allows effective panting) make them physiologically designed for exactly the temperatures and humidity that Mumbai serves up.

**Indies can walk comfortably in conditions that would be dangerous for brachycephalic breeds and uncomfortable for double-coated breeds.** That said, they are not invulnerable. During the peak of May heat (35+ degrees with high humidity), even Indies should avoid the 11 AM to 4 PM window. But they handle 8 AM and 5 PM walks in April far better than a Pug or a Golden Retriever would.

**Route diversity is the most important factor for Indies.** Because their exercise needs are as much mental as physical, varying your routes is more valuable than increasing distance. Alternate between parks, residential areas, market streets (during quiet hours), and waterfront paths if accessible. Indies who were street dogs before adoption may initially react strongly to traffic, crowds, or specific triggers from their past. Gradual, positive exposure during walks helps them build confidence.

**Monsoon season** is well-tolerated by Indies. Their short coat dries quickly, and many Indies enjoy rain. Standard precautions apply: avoid waterlogged areas, check for debris and sharp objects, and dry paw pads after walks.

## Signs Your Indie Dog Isn't Getting Enough Exercise

Indies are adaptable, but adaptability has limits. An under-exercised Indie will show it:

- **Escape attempts** — Indies are agile, resourceful, and excellent at finding ways out of enclosures. A bored Indie will try to get out because they are seeking the stimulation they are not getting inside. If your Indie is constantly trying to slip through doors or gates, they need more exercise.
- **Territorial behaviour** — guarding windows, barking at passers-by, marking inside the house. These behaviours intensify when an Indie does not get enough physical outlet.
- **Anxiety and hypervigilance** — pacing, startling at sounds, inability to relax. This is particularly common in recently adopted Indies who are not getting enough structured activity to channel their energy.
- **Destructive chewing and digging** — Indies are intelligent dogs solving the problem of boredom with the tools available to them.
- **Social regression** — an Indie who was friendly with other dogs but starts showing reactivity or avoidance may be under-stimulated and redirecting frustration.

These signs mirror many post-adoption behavioural challenges that are incorrectly attributed to the dog's "street background" when they are actually under-exercise symptoms. For more, read our guide on [signs your dog needs more exercise](/blog/signs-dog-needs-more-exercise).

## Walking Safety Tips for Indie Dog Owners

**Leash training may take time for adopted Indies.** Many adopted Indies have never worn a leash before. Start with a well-fitted harness (not a collar — many rescue Indies have sensitive necks from past experiences) and short, positive sessions in a familiar environment before graduating to street walks. Patience here pays enormous dividends.

**Reactivity management.** Some adopted Indies carry triggers from street life — fear of sticks, certain sounds, uniformed people, or specific locations. If your Indie shows reactivity during walks, do not force exposure. Increase distance from the trigger, reward calm behaviour, and work with a positive-reinforcement trainer if needed.

**Vaccination and deworming status must be current.** This applies to all dogs, but adopted Indies may have gaps in their medical history. Ensure your dog is fully vaccinated (including leptospirosis, particularly relevant during Mumbai's monsoon) before regular walks in public spaces.

**Identification is critical.** Indies have a strong prey drive and excellent spatial memory. An Indie that slips their leash may run farther and navigate more confidently than most breeds. Ensure your Indie wears a collar with ID tags during every walk, and consider microchipping if not already done.
