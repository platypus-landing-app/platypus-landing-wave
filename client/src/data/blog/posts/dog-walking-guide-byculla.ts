Byculla occupies a unique position in Mumbai's geography and history. Situated in South-Central Mumbai, it was once the city's most fashionable address, home to grand residences, tree-lined boulevards, and the famous Victoria Gardens (now Jijamata Udyaan). While much of that grandeur has faded, what remains is a neighbourhood with wide roads by Mumbai standards, an extraordinary collection of heritage architecture, and a density of open spaces that most South Mumbai areas cannot match.

For dog parents, Byculla presents an unusual opportunity. The area is less gentrified and less trafficked than its neighbours, which means quieter streets, fewer competing pedestrians, and a more relaxed walking environment. The proximity to Mazgaon's elevated terrain adds variety, while the streets around Gloria Church and Clare Road maintain a residential calm that supports consistent daily walks. It is a part of the city where walking your dog still feels like a genuine neighbourhood experience rather than an obstacle course through traffic and construction.

## Best Dog Walking Routes in Byculla

### Jijamata Udyaan Periphery Circuit

Jijamata Udyaan (the zoo and botanical garden) does not permit dogs inside. However, the roads surrounding it form one of the best walking circuits in Central Mumbai. The perimeter road is wide, tree-lined with some of the oldest trees in the city, and has a pedestrian-friendly character that has survived decades of urban change. A full circuit around the garden's outer wall covers approximately 2.5 kilometres.

Start from the main entrance on Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar Road and walk clockwise. The eastern side of the circuit is quieter, with fewer commercial establishments and less vehicle traffic. The western side passes closer to the Byculla station area and is busier, but still manageable before 8 AM. The canopy cover from banyan, neem, and gulmohar trees is excellent, keeping temperatures comfortable well into the morning.

The best walking window is 5:30 to 7:30 AM. By 8 AM, school buses and commercial traffic pick up significantly. Evening walks between 6:00 and 7:30 PM also work, though the area around the zoo entrance gets crowded with visitors during weekends and holidays. This route is suitable for all breeds and energy levels. The flat, paved terrain and ample shade make it particularly good for senior dogs and brachycephalic breeds.

### Mazgaon Hill Gradient Walk

Mazgaon is one of the few areas in Mumbai with genuine elevation change, and this makes it exceptional for dog walks. The old residential streets leading up from the Clare Road area toward the Mazgaon Hill offer gentle to moderate inclines that provide cardiovascular benefit for both you and your dog without requiring a trek to a distant trail.

The route from near the Dockyard Road junction, up through the Mazgaon residential streets, past Gloria Church, and toward the Mazgaon Gardens covers about 2 kilometres with a noticeable elevation gain. The architecture along this route is striking: colonial-era buildings, old churches, and heritage structures line the streets. Dogs benefit from the incline variation, which engages different muscle groups compared to flat walking, and the elevated sections offer better air circulation and cooler temperatures.

Gloria Church and its surrounding lanes are particularly peaceful. The church compound has old trees and a quiet atmosphere that makes for a natural rest stop during the walk. Many local pet parents make the church a turnaround point for shorter walks. The Mazgaon Hill walk is best done in the morning between 6:00 and 8:00 AM, when the streets are at their quietest and the gradient feels comfortable rather than strenuous.

### Clare Road to Dr. Ambedkar Road Heritage Walk

For a flatter, more urban route, the stretch from Clare Road along Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar Road toward Byculla Bridge offers a straightforward linear walk. The road is one of the widest in this part of the city, with a reasonable footpath on the southern side. The walk passes several heritage buildings, the Byculla fire station, and various neighbourhood landmarks.

This route covers about 2 kilometres one-way. It is more functional than scenic, but it works well for dogs that need distance and a brisk pace. The street activity provides controlled urban exposure, which is good for dogs in socialisation training. Keep your dog on the side away from the road and maintain a short leash near junctions, where auto-rickshaws and buses turn without much warning.

## Dog-Friendly Parks and Open Spaces

Mazgaon Gardens, perched on Mazgaon Hill, is the primary open space for dog owners in the area. The garden is elevated, offering views and breeze that are unusual for a Mumbai neighbourhood park. It has a walking path, benches, and patches of grass where smaller dogs can play. The garden gets busy with morning exercisers between 6:30 and 8:00 AM, but the atmosphere is welcoming toward dog walkers.

The open area near the Byculla market, on the eastern side of the main road, has a few informal patches of ground used by local pet parents. These are not maintained parks and the surface can be uneven, so inspect the area before letting your dog off-leash.

For a day trip, the nearby [Dadar area](/blog/dog-walking-guide-dadar) has Shivaji Park, one of Mumbai's largest open spaces and a destination-worthy dog walking spot.

The area around the Rani Baug (another name for Jijamata Udyaan) has a small public garden on the eastern side that is less known and less crowded. The garden is modest, but the tree cover is mature and the atmosphere during early mornings is tranquil. It works well for nervous dogs or those needing a low-stimulus outdoor experience.

## Walking Tips for Byculla

**Heritage area means uneven surfaces.** Many of Byculla's older streets have cobblestones, broken footpaths, and uneven kerbs. This adds character to the walk but demands attention, especially with small dogs or seniors that can stumble. Watch your footing and your dog's.

**Water is essential in this part of the city.** Central Mumbai heats up faster and retains heat longer than the western suburbs, thanks to reduced sea breeze and denser construction. Carry at least 500 ml of water per 30 minutes of walking. Between March and May, the Jijamata Udyaan periphery road can feel significantly warmer by 8 AM despite the tree cover. Consult our [summer walking safety guide](/blog/summer-dog-walking-safety-mumbai) for breed-specific heat management.

**Monsoon flooding affects Byculla.** Parts of Clare Road and the area near Byculla Bridge are prone to waterlogging during heavy monsoon rains. Stagnant water collects bacteria and can cause skin infections and gastrointestinal issues in dogs. Avoid waterlogged stretches entirely and carry a towel to dry your dog's paws after walks during the rainy season. For complete monsoon advice, read our [monsoon safety tips](/blog/dog-walking-safety-tips-mumbai-monsoon).

**Stray dogs are present but manageable.** Byculla has an active stray population, particularly near the market areas and around food establishments. The residential lanes and the Jijamata Udyaan periphery have lower stray density. Walk with confidence, keep your dog close at junctions, and avoid areas where strays are visibly gathered.

## Breed Recommendations for Byculla Routes

The Jijamata Udyaan periphery circuit is universal. Its flat, shaded, wide path accommodates everything from Chihuahuas to Saint Bernards. Brachycephalic breeds like Pugs, English Bulldogs, and Shih Tzus do well here thanks to the exceptional tree cover. Senior dogs and recovering dogs will appreciate the gentle, predictable terrain.

The Mazgaon Hill gradient walk is best suited for fit, medium to large breeds. Labradors, German Shepherds, Indian Pariah dogs, and Boxers benefit most from the incline work. This is also an excellent route for young, high-energy dogs (over one year old) that need to burn more energy than flat walks provide. Avoid this route with very small breeds, dogs with hip dysplasia, or brachycephalic breeds that struggle with inclines.

The Clare Road linear walk suits medium-energy breeds comfortable in urban settings. Beagles, Cocker Spaniels, and Indie dogs handle the traffic exposure and distance well. It is also a good training route for dogs working on heel command and urban desensitisation.

## Professional Dog Walking in Byculla with Platypus

Byculla's layered geography, from flat heritage roads to hillside gradients, means the right walking route depends entirely on your dog's breed, age, and fitness level. Our Platypus Guardians who cover Byculla understand this terrain intimately. They know which section of the zoo periphery is quietest at 6:30 AM, whether the Mazgaon Hill streets had any overnight flooding, and when Gloria Church's lanes are at their most peaceful.

Every walk is GPS-tracked with real-time updates, so you know exactly where your dog is and how the walk is progressing. If you live in Byculla, Mazgaon, Mandvi, or Clare Road, book a [professional dog walking in Byculla](/dog-walking/byculla) trial walk at Rs. 199. Your dog gets a certified Guardian who matches the route to their needs, not the other way around.
