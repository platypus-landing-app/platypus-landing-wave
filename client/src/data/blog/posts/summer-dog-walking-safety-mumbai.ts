Mumbai's summer temperatures regularly hit 35-40°C, and the humidity makes it feel even worse. For humans, it's uncomfortable. For dogs, it can be genuinely dangerous. Dogs don't sweat like we do — they regulate body temperature primarily through panting, which becomes less effective as humidity rises. This makes Mumbai's combination of heat and humidity particularly risky for dogs during walks.

Every summer, veterinary clinics across Mumbai see a spike in heatstroke cases, burnt paw pads, and dehydration — most of which are entirely preventable with the right precautions. Here's everything you need to know to keep your dog safe during hot weather walks.

## The Pavement Problem

This is the danger most pet parents underestimate. When the air temperature is 35°C, asphalt surface temperature can reach 60-65°C. That's hot enough to cook an egg — and hot enough to cause second-degree burns on your dog's paw pads within seconds.

The seven-second test is non-negotiable: place the back of your hand flat on the pavement and hold it there for seven seconds. If you can't keep it there comfortably, your dog shouldn't be walking on it. This simple test should become a habit before every summer walk.

At Platypus, our Guardians are trained to check pavement temperature before every walk and to stick to grass, shaded paths, and cooler surfaces when the ground is hot. It's one of those small protocols that makes a significant difference.

## Timing Is Everything

The safest walking windows during Mumbai summers are before 7 AM and after 6:30 PM. The 10 AM to 4 PM window is a hard no — pavement is at its hottest, air temperature peaks, and there's minimal shade in most urban areas.

Early morning walks are ideal. The pavement has had all night to cool down, the air is at its freshest, and your dog gets the stimulation they need before the heat sets in. Evening walks work too, but check the pavement — it retains heat well into the evening, especially concrete and dark asphalt.

If your dog needs a midday walk, keep it extremely short — just enough for a bathroom break — and stick entirely to grass or shaded dirt paths.

## Recognising Heatstroke

Heatstroke in dogs escalates fast and can become life-threatening within minutes. Every dog owner in Mumbai needs to know the signs:

**Early warning signs:** Excessive panting, thick drooling, bright red tongue and gums, restlessness, seeking shade obsessively.

**Danger signs:** Lethargy, stumbling or loss of coordination, vomiting, diarrhoea, glazed eyes, rapid heartbeat.

**Emergency signs:** Collapse, seizures, unconsciousness. This is a veterinary emergency — get to a clinic immediately.

Brachycephalic breeds — Pugs, Bulldogs, Shih Tzus, Boxers — are at significantly higher risk because their shortened airways make panting less efficient. Senior dogs, overweight dogs, and puppies are also more vulnerable.

If you suspect heatstroke, move the dog to shade immediately, apply cool (not cold) water to their neck, armpits, and groin area, offer small sips of water, and get to a vet. Do not use ice water — the sudden temperature change can cause shock.

## Hydration Strategy

A 20-kilogram dog needs roughly 40-60ml of water per kilogram per day under normal conditions — and significantly more during hot weather and exercise. During summer walks, carry fresh water and a collapsible bowl, and offer water every 10-15 minutes.

Watch for signs of dehydration: dry gums, loss of skin elasticity (gently pinch the skin on the back of their neck — if it doesn't snap back immediately, they're dehydrated), sunken eyes, and lethargy.

Pre-hydrate before walks. Make sure your dog has access to fresh water 30 minutes before heading out. Post-walk, offer water again but don't let them gulp large quantities at once — small, frequent sips prevent stomach issues.

## Route Planning for Summer

Not all walking routes are equal in summer. Prioritise:

**Tree-lined streets and parks** — Natural canopy reduces ground temperature significantly. Areas like Aarey Colony, parts of Jogger's Park, and tree-lined residential streets in Bandra and Powai are markedly cooler than open roads.

**Grass and dirt paths** — These surfaces stay 15-20°C cooler than asphalt or concrete. Whenever possible, walk on grass.

**Near water bodies** — Powai Lake trails, Carter Road promenade, and Juhu Beach (early morning only) offer sea breezes and cooler microclimates.

**Avoid:** Open concrete areas, parking lots, main roads with no shade, and any route that's mostly exposed to direct sunlight.

## Breed-Specific Considerations

Some breeds handle Mumbai's heat better than others. Indian breeds like the Indian Pariah Dog and Mudhol Hound are naturally adapted to heat. Northern breeds like Huskies, Malamutes, and Saint Bernards suffer disproportionately and need extra precaution — shorter walks, more water breaks, and strictly early morning timing.

Double-coated breeds should never be shaved in an attempt to cool them down. Their coat actually provides insulation against heat. Instead, ensure regular brushing to remove the undercoat and improve air circulation.

## Summer Walking Kit

Every summer walk should include:

Water bottle and collapsible bowl. Non-negotiable. A cooling bandana — soak in cool water and wrap around your dog's neck. Paw wax or booties for dogs sensitive to warm surfaces. A towel for wiping down after walks. Your phone — for GPS tracking if you're using a walking service, and in case of emergencies.

## What We Do at Platypus

Our summer protocols are strict. Guardians check pavement temperature before every walk, carry water on every outing, and are trained to recognise early heatstroke signs. Walk times are automatically adjusted during peak summer — no walks scheduled during the danger window unless specifically on shaded routes. Live GPS tracking means you can see exactly where your dog is walking and for how long.

Mumbai summers are manageable with the right precautions. The key is respecting the heat, planning around it, and never assuming your dog can handle what you can handle. They can't regulate temperature as efficiently as humans, and they rely on us to make smart decisions for them.
