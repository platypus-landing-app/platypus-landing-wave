Mumbai may be one of the most densely packed cities in the world, but it still holds some wonderful spots for dog walks if you know where to look. From breezy seafront promenades to lush green trails, the city and its surrounding areas offer diverse terrain for dogs of every breed and energy level. Here are ten of the best dog-friendly walking routes every Mumbai pet parent should know about.

## 1. Carter Road, Bandra

Carter Road's seafront promenade is one of Mumbai's most popular dog walking spots, and for good reason. The wide, paved pathway runs along the Arabian Sea, offering cool breezes and a scenic backdrop. Early mornings before 7 AM and evenings after 6 PM are the best times, when the promenade is less crowded and the temperature is comfortable. The flat terrain makes it suitable for dogs of all ages, including senior dogs and puppies.

## 2. Juhu Beach

Juhu Beach is a favourite among pet parents in western Mumbai. The expansive stretch of sand gives dogs room to explore, and the early morning hours offer a relatively quiet window before the crowds arrive. Best visited between 5:30 and 7:30 AM, Juhu is ideal for high-energy breeds that enjoy running on sand. Keep your dog on a leash near food stalls and be mindful of the rising tide.

## 3. Powai Lake

The walking path around Powai Lake offers a calm, green environment that feels worlds away from the chaos of the city. The tree-lined trail provides natural shade, making it a good option even on warmer days. Powai Lake is particularly well-suited for medium-energy breeds and dogs that enjoy a steady, relaxed pace. Mornings are best—the area gets busier with joggers by mid-morning.

## 4. Worli Sea Face

Worli Sea Face provides a long, uninterrupted stretch of promenade with stunning views of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. The wide pathway accommodates dogs comfortably, and the constant sea breeze keeps temperatures pleasant. This route works well for brisk walks with active breeds. Visit early in the morning or after sunset to avoid the heat and the heaviest foot traffic.

## 5. Aarey Colony, Goregaon

For a more nature-oriented walk, Aarey Colony is hard to beat. This green pocket in the heart of the city offers unpaved trails, forest cover, and fresh air. Dogs love the natural terrain and the abundance of new scents. Aarey is best suited for well-trained dogs comfortable on varied surfaces. Morning walks here are particularly refreshing, though you should stay on marked paths and keep your dog leashed due to occasional wildlife.

## 6. Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Borivali

The park's walking trails at the periphery offer a unique experience for adventurous dogs and their parents. The lush greenery, gentle slopes, and shaded paths make it excellent for longer walks. Note that dogs are generally allowed only in designated areas near the entrance, not deep inside the park. Early mornings between 6 and 8 AM are the best window. This route suits energetic breeds that enjoy a good trek.

## 7. Shivaji Park, Dadar

Shivaji Park is one of central Mumbai's largest open spaces and a reliable option for pet parents in the Dadar area. The area surrounding the main ground offers enough room for a satisfying walk, and the flat terrain is gentle on older dogs' joints. The best times are early morning and late evening. It is a social spot too—you will often find other pet parents and their dogs here.

## 8. Palm Beach Road, Navi Mumbai

For pet parents on the other side of the harbour, Palm Beach Road offers a long, well-maintained stretch perfect for dog walks. The wide footpaths, relatively low traffic, and open views of the creek make it one of Navi Mumbai's best-kept secrets for dog walking. It suits all breeds and energy levels, and the generous space means your dog will not feel cramped. Mornings and evenings are equally pleasant.

## 9. Yeoor Hills, Thane

Yeoor Hills provides a semi-wilderness walking experience just outside Mumbai. The forested trails, gentle inclines, and clean air make it ideal for dogs that crave adventure and variety. It is best for fit, active breeds comfortable with off-road terrain. Visit on weekday mornings for a quieter experience. Keep your dog leashed on the trails, as the area is home to various bird species and small wildlife.

## 10. Versova Beach

Versova Beach, after its well-publicized cleanup efforts, has become a viable option for dog walks in the Andheri-Versova belt. The beach is less crowded than Juhu, offering more space for dogs to enjoy the sand and surf. Early mornings are the prime time. The beach is best for dogs that enjoy water and sand but may not be ideal during monsoon season when currents get strong.
