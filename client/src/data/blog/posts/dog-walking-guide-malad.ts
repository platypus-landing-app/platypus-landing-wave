Malad is one of those Mumbai suburbs that gets overlooked in conversations about dog-friendly areas, usually in favour of more photogenic neighbourhoods to the south. That is a mistake. Malad, particularly its western half, has a network of residential lanes, a handful of well-maintained gardens, and a pace of life that is noticeably slower than the Andheri-Bandra stretch. For dog parents, this translates into quieter walks, fewer confrontations with traffic, and enough green cover to keep things interesting.

The area spans a wide range of character. Malad West has the upscale pockets around Mindspace and Evershine Nagar, with wide roads and apartment complexes that often have internal walking paths. Malad East is denser and more commercial near the station, but opens up as you move toward Kurar and the foothills. Orlem, the old Catholic village neighbourhood, offers some of the most charming walking lanes in all of the western suburbs.

## Best Dog Walking Routes in Malad

### Orlem Village Lanes

Orlem is Malad's hidden gem for dog walks. The neighbourhood around St. Blaise Church has narrow, quiet lanes with a distinctly old-Bombay character. Low-rise bungalows, small gardens, and mature trees line the streets. Vehicle traffic is minimal, especially before 8 AM and after 7 PM. The pace here is relaxed, and dogs respond to it. You will notice even anxious dogs settling into a calmer walk within the first few minutes.

The loop from the church through the internal Orlem lanes and back covers about 1.5 kilometres, making it ideal for a 25 to 35 minute morning walk. The roads are paved but narrow, so you will be walking on the road itself rather than a footpath. This is fine given the low traffic, but keep your dog on a short leash and stay alert for the occasional scooter. Orlem is particularly well-suited for older dogs, smaller breeds, and dogs recovering from injury who need gentle, low-stimulus exercise.

### Mindspace to Evershine Nagar Circuit

The stretch from Mindspace (the IT park area, not to be confused with Mindspace Mall) through Evershine Nagar offers a longer, more structured walk. The roads here are wider, the footpaths are in reasonable condition, and the apartment complexes provide a sense of order. Start at the Mindspace junction and walk through Evershine Nagar's internal roads toward the garden near Malad Link Road. The circuit covers about 2.5 kilometres and takes 40 to 50 minutes at a moderate pace.

This route works well for medium to large breeds that need a proper distance walk. The morning window between 6:00 and 7:30 AM is best. After that, the area fills with commuters heading toward Malad Station and the commercial zone around Inorbit Mall. The Evershine Nagar stretch has several chai stalls and small shops where dogs are generally tolerated, making it easy to take a quick water break.

### Malad East Foothills Path

For pet parents in Malad East, the area near the foothills leading toward the Sanjay Gandhi National Park periphery offers a completely different walking experience. The terrain here is uneven, with packed earth paths and gentle inclines. It feels more like a nature walk than an urban stroll. The tree cover is thick, providing shade even on warm days, and the air quality noticeably improves as you move away from the main road.

This route is best for adventurous dogs comfortable with varied terrain. Avoid it during and immediately after monsoon, as the paths become slippery and muddy. The stretch from Kurar village toward the forest boundary is about 2 kilometres each way. For monsoon walking precautions, see our [monsoon safety tips](/blog/dog-walking-safety-tips-mumbai-monsoon).

## Dog-Friendly Parks and Open Spaces

Malad has a few gardens that double as informal dog socialisation spots. The garden near Malad West station, sometimes called Collector's Garden, is a modest green space where pet parents gather every morning between 6:30 and 8:00 AM. It is small, so it works better for smaller dogs or well-socialised dogs that do not need much space. The space near Evershine Nagar also has an open ground where dogs play off-leash in the early morning, though this is informal and not fenced.

For a more spacious option, the open grounds near Pushpa Park in Malad West offer room for fetch and free play. The ground is uneven in places, so check for holes and debris before letting your dog run. On weekday mornings, you will often find a small community of regulars with their dogs, which creates a relaxed, predictable social environment.

If you are willing to travel ten minutes, the [Goregaon area](/blog/dog-walking-guide-goregaon) offers Aarey Colony, which is one of the best nature walking spots in Mumbai.

## Walking Tips for Malad

**Plan around the station rush.** Malad Station is one of the busiest in the western suburbs. Walking routes that pass near the station or the main SV Road should be avoided between 8:00 and 10:00 AM and 6:00 to 8:00 PM. The noise, crowds, and vehicle congestion are stressful for most dogs.

**Hydration is non-negotiable.** Malad West's internal roads have limited shade in the stretch between Mindspace and the Link Road. During summer months (March through May), carry at least 500 ml of water for every 20 minutes of walking. A collapsible silicone bowl is essential kit. For detailed summer walking advice, refer to our [summer walking safety guide](/blog/summer-dog-walking-safety-mumbai).

**Stray dog density varies.** Orlem and the Evershine Nagar residential areas have relatively fewer strays compared to the commercial zones near the station and the Inorbit Mall approach road. If your dog is reactive toward other dogs, plan your route through the residential stretches and avoid the SV Road corridor.

**Footpath quality is inconsistent.** While some stretches in Evershine Nagar have proper footpaths, many roads in Malad require walking on the road itself. Keep your dog on the side away from traffic and use a short, fixed-length leash rather than a retractable one.

## Breed Recommendations for Malad Routes

The Orlem lanes are perfect for toy and small breeds: Shih Tzus, Lhasa Apsos, Dachshunds, and Pomeranians thrive in the quiet, low-traffic environment. Brachycephalic breeds like Pugs and French Bulldogs do well here too, since the walks are short and the pace is gentle.

The Mindspace to Evershine Nagar circuit suits medium breeds with moderate energy. Beagles, Cocker Spaniels, and Indian Pariah dogs handle the distance and mixed terrain comfortably. Labradors and Golden Retrievers also do well on this route, though they will benefit from a longer version that loops back through the residential side streets.

The foothills path is best reserved for fit, active dogs. German Shepherds, Dobermans, and energetic Indie dogs will appreciate the inclines and natural terrain. This is not recommended for very small dogs, senior dogs, or breeds with joint issues like Dachshunds and Basset Hounds.
