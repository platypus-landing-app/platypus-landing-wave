The Beagle is one of the most misunderstood breeds when it comes to exercise. People see a small, compact dog and assume they are low-maintenance. They are not. Beagles were bred as pack hounds, developed over centuries to track rabbits and hare across English countryside for hours at a stretch. That nose — with roughly 220 million scent receptors compared to a human's 5 million — drives nearly everything they do. A Beagle on a walk is not just walking. They are processing a constantly updating map of smells, and that mental engagement is as tiring and necessary for them as physical distance.

Beagles are among the most commonly surrendered breeds in India, often because pet parents underestimate their exercise and stimulation needs. Understanding what a Beagle truly requires is the first step to living happily with one.

## How Much Walking Does a Beagle Need?

An adult Beagle needs **45 to 60 minutes of walking per day**, ideally split into two sessions. A 20 to 25 minute morning walk and a 30 to 35 minute evening walk works well for most adult Beagles. The evening session should ideally be the longer one, as Beagles tend to be more active and engaged during cooler hours.

**The quality of a Beagle walk matters more than the distance.** This breed benefits enormously from "scent walks" — sessions where you deliberately slow down and let your Beagle lead with their nose. Instead of marching at a brisk pace, allow them to stop, sniff, investigate, and process. A 30-minute scent walk can be more satisfying for a Beagle than a 45-minute walk at a fast pace where they are constantly being pulled away from interesting smells.

Alternate between structured walks (maintaining pace and heel position) and scent walks. This combination gives them both the physical exercise and the mental stimulation they need.

**Puppies** should follow the five-minutes-per-month-of-age rule. A three-month-old Beagle gets two 15-minute sessions. Beagle puppies are curious and fearless, which means they need close supervision during walks to prevent them from swallowing things they find on the ground.

**Senior Beagles** (typically nine years and older) do well with 20 to 30 minutes of gentle walking. Beagles are a relatively long-lived breed (12 to 15 years), and maintaining daily walks through their senior years helps manage weight and keeps their joints mobile.

## Best Walking Conditions for Beagles in Mumbai

Beagles have a short, dense coat that handles Mumbai's climate better than most European breeds. They have moderate heat tolerance — not as vulnerable as double-coated breeds, but not as hardy as Indian breeds either.

**During March through May**, walk before 8 AM and after 6 PM. During Mumbai's cooler months and monsoon season, Beagles can comfortably walk at most hours, though midday sun should still be avoided.

**Route selection for Beagles should prioritise scent richness.** Parks with varied vegetation, trails near gardens, and routes through quieter residential lanes offer more olfactory stimulation than open, paved roads. Beagles are happiest on routes where there is a lot to smell — other dogs have passed, food stalls are nearby, or there is natural greenery.

**Monsoon season** is generally well-tolerated by Beagles, but their nose can lead them into trouble in waterlogged areas. They may try to eat things washed up by rain, and standing water carries leptospirosis risk. Keep them on leash near drainage areas and puddles. For detailed monsoon precautions, read our [monsoon walking safety guide](/blog/dog-walking-safety-tips-mumbai-monsoon).

**A note on early morning walks.** Beagles are vocal dogs, and encountering other dogs, cats, or interesting smells during walks can trigger baying — their signature loud, prolonged howl. In residential areas during early morning hours, this can be a consideration. An experienced handler who knows how to redirect a Beagle's attention can manage this effectively.

## Signs Your Beagle Isn't Getting Enough Exercise

Beagles communicate under-exercise in ways that are both predictable and, if you do not understand the breed, infuriating:

- **Excessive howling and baying** — a Beagle with pent-up energy will vocalise relentlessly. This is not them being "talkative." It is frustration.
- **Destructive digging** — Beagles are natural diggers, but the behaviour intensifies dramatically when they are under-stimulated.
- **Counter surfing and food theft** — Beagles are food-motivated at the best of times, but an under-exercised Beagle turns into a kitchen raider of extraordinary creativity.
- **Pulling harder on leash** — a Beagle that is not getting adequate daily exercise will pull with even more determination because every walk becomes desperately important.
- **Weight gain** — Beagles gain weight easily, and combined with their food motivation, an inactive lifestyle leads to obesity quickly.

These are not personality defects — they are unmet needs. For a deeper look, read our guide on [signs your dog needs more exercise](/blog/signs-dog-needs-more-exercise).

## Walking Safety Tips for Beagle Owners

**Leash management is the biggest challenge.** Beagles are scent hounds, and when they lock onto a smell, their entire brain redirects to tracking it. A Beagle that catches an interesting scent will pull with surprising force for their size (typically 10 to 12 kilograms) and become essentially deaf to verbal commands. A front-clip harness is the most effective tool — it redirects their forward momentum toward you rather than away. Never use a retractable leash with a Beagle; you will lose control the moment something interesting crosses their path.

**Recall is unreliable.** This is a breed reality, not a training failure. Even well-trained Beagles have poor recall when scent-tracking. Never walk a Beagle off-leash in an unfenced area. A Beagle that picks up a trail can run for kilometres without looking back.

**Watch what they eat.** Beagles are indiscriminate eaters, and Mumbai's streets have plenty of hazards — discarded food, chicken bones, garbage. Train a strong "leave it" command and maintain vigilance during walks. If your Beagle swallows something questionable, note the time and watch for vomiting, lethargy, or abdominal distress.

**Paw and ear care.** Check paw pads after walks on hot pavement, and inspect their long, floppy ears after every walk — especially during monsoon. Beagle ears trap moisture easily, creating ideal conditions for ear infections. Wipe the inner ear with a dry cloth after wet walks.

## Walking Your Beagle with Platypus

At **Platypus**, we know that walking a Beagle requires a specific skill set. Our Guardians are trained in scent-hound management — they understand how to balance letting a Beagle explore olfactorily while maintaining control and safety. Every Beagle walk includes dedicated sniffing time built into the session, not treated as an interruption.

We also understand the leash dynamics. Our Guardians use appropriate equipment and techniques to manage pulling without resorting to aversive tools. The result is a walk that leaves your Beagle genuinely tired and satisfied — not just dragged around the block.

If your Beagle needs walks from someone who truly understands the breed, [explore our professional dog walking service](/services/dog-walking). A properly walked Beagle is a quieter, calmer, and much happier dog.
