Versova sits at a fascinating intersection of old Mumbai and new. On one side, you have the fishing village with its narrow lanes and the smell of salt in the air. On the other, the wide, tree-lined streets of Seven Bungalows and the residential calm of Yari Road. For dog parents, this means variety. You can take your dog for a sandy beach run one morning and a shaded residential stroll the next, all within a couple of kilometres.

The area's transformation over the past decade, particularly the well-publicised Versova Beach cleanup, has made the coastline far more accessible for dog walks. Combined with relatively lower foot traffic compared to nearby Juhu, Versova has quietly become one of the better dog walking neighbourhoods in western Mumbai.

## Best Dog Walking Routes in Versova

### Versova Beach Promenade and Shore Walk

Versova Beach remains the headline attraction. The stretch from the main beach access point near Bhagat Singh Garden down toward the fishing jetty offers a mix of packed sand and softer patches closer to the waterline. Early mornings between 5:30 and 7:00 AM are ideal. The beach is largely empty at this hour, the sand is cool, and you will often see other pet parents taking advantage of the quiet. Dogs that enjoy running off-leash can cover good ground here, though you should keep them leashed near the fishing boats and the jetty area where nets are spread out to dry.

The terrain shifts as you walk south. Closer to the jetty, the sand becomes coarser and mixed with rocks. This is actually good for dogs that need nail wear and varied paw stimulation, but avoid this stretch with puppies or senior dogs with sensitive joints. During monsoon months (June through September), avoid the waterline entirely as currents become unpredictable. For monsoon-specific advice, check our [monsoon safety tips](/blog/dog-walking-safety-tips-mumbai-monsoon).

### Seven Bungalows Internal Roads

If your dog prefers pavement and shade to sand, the internal roads of Seven Bungalows are excellent. The lanes between Yari Road and the main Seven Bungalows stretch are lined with mature trees, mostly rain trees and gulmohar, which provide a thick canopy during most of the year. The roads are relatively wide by Mumbai standards, with low vehicle traffic early in the morning and after 7 PM.

Start from the junction near D.N. Nagar Metro station and walk northwest toward Versova. The footpaths here are reasonably maintained, and the residential character means fewer stray dogs compared to commercial areas. This is a particularly good route for reactive dogs or those that are still building confidence, as encounters with other dogs are manageable and the sightlines are clear.

### Yari Road to Versova Fort Loop

For a longer walk, the route from Yari Road up toward Versova Fort and back makes for a satisfying circuit of about 3 kilometres. The path takes you through a mix of residential streets and the quieter back lanes near the fort. The Versova Fort area itself is not maintained as a park, but the approach roads are peaceful, especially on weekday mornings. This loop works well for medium to high-energy dogs that need more than a quick neighbourhood circuit.

## Dog-Friendly Parks and Open Spaces

Versova does not have a dedicated, fenced dog park, but several open spaces serve the purpose well. Bhagat Singh Garden, located near the beach entrance, offers a modest green area where dogs can be found socialising every morning and evening. It gets busy around 6:30 to 7:30 AM and again around 6:00 to 7:30 PM. The garden is small but well-frequented by regulars, so your dog will likely meet the same companions repeatedly, which is excellent for building social confidence.

The open plots along the Versova-Andheri Link Road, while not formally parks, are used by local dog parents for off-leash play during quieter hours. These spaces are unpaved and may have debris, so check the ground before letting your dog off-leash. The area near Lokhandwala Complex also has a few pocket gardens that accommodate dog walkers, though these are slightly outside the Versova core.

## Walking Tips for Versova

**Timing matters more than anywhere.** Versova Beach gets crowded with joggers, fitness groups, and photographers by 7:30 AM, especially on weekends. If your dog is anxious around crowds, stick to the 5:30 to 6:30 AM window or walk the internal roads instead.

**Sand temperature is real.** Between March and May, beach sand in Versova can become uncomfortably hot by 8:00 AM. Test it with the back of your hand. If you cannot hold it for five seconds, it is too hot for your dog's paws. Stick to the wet sand near the waterline or shift to the shaded Seven Bungalows route. For detailed summer precautions, read our [summer walking safety guide](/blog/summer-dog-walking-safety-mumbai).

**Watch for fishing activity.** The working fishing jetty means nets, hooks, and fish remnants are common along the southern stretch of the beach. Dogs are naturally attracted to the smell, and swallowing fish bones or getting tangled in nets is a genuine risk. Keep your dog leashed when passing through the fishing zone.

**Carry water.** Despite the beach proximity, there are no public water points for dogs along most Versova walking routes. Carry a collapsible bowl and at least 500 ml of water per 30 minutes of walking.

## Breed Recommendations for Versova Routes

Versova's beach route is a natural fit for high-energy breeds. Labradors, Golden Retrievers, and Indie dogs thrive on the sand, and the open space lets them stretch into a full run. Breeds that enjoy water, like Labradors and Cocker Spaniels, will gravitate toward the shoreline, though you should rinse salt water off their coat afterward to prevent skin irritation.

The Seven Bungalows residential route suits smaller breeds and brachycephalic (flat-faced) dogs like Pugs and Shih Tzus. The shade cover keeps temperatures manageable, and the flat pavement is easy on shorter legs. Senior dogs of any breed will also do well here, as the route can be shortened or extended based on their stamina.

For the Versova Fort loop, medium to large breeds with good endurance are the best fit. Beagles, German Shepherds, and Indian Pariah dogs handle the mixed terrain and distance comfortably. Puppies under six months should stick to shorter stretches until their joints are fully developed.

They carry water, waste bags, and GPS trackers on every walk, sending you real-time updates so you know exactly where your dog is and how the walk is going.
