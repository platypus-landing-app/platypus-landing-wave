Mulund sits at Mumbai's northeastern boundary, where the city begins its transition into Thane. This position gives Mulund something most Mumbai suburbs can only dream of—proximity to actual hills and forest cover. The foothills of Sanjay Gandhi National Park brush against Mulund West, and the residential areas of Mulund East open toward the Thane Creek. Between the hills and the creek, the neighbourhood has developed into a spacious, well-planned residential zone with wide roads, established housing colonies, and some of the best-maintained public gardens in the eastern suburbs. For dog owners, Mulund is as good as it gets within Mumbai city limits.

The neighbourhood's appeal for dog walking extends beyond its green spaces. Mulund was developed as a residential suburb in the 1960s and 1970s, which means the road layout is more generous than newer developments. Internal colony roads are wide, tree-lined, and designed for low-traffic residential use. The population density, while substantial, is lower than the central and western suburbs, which translates to less pavement congestion and more room for dogs to walk comfortably.

## Best Dog Walking Routes in Mulund

**Mulund West Colony Roads to National Park Foothills** is the standout walking route in the neighbourhood. Starting from the residential lanes in Mulund West, you head northwest along progressively quieter roads toward the foothills that mark the boundary of Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The terrain transitions from flat, paved residential streets to slightly undulating paths with mixed surfaces as you approach the hills. The full route can be stretched to 4 kilometres or more depending on how far you climb, making it one of the longest urban-to-nature walking routes available anywhere in Mumbai. The foothill area has unpaved trails with natural shade from deciduous and semi-evergreen trees—dogs love the varied terrain and the explosion of natural scents. The morning window between 5:30 and 7 AM is best. Keep your dog leashed in the foothill area, as the proximity to the national park means occasional wildlife sightings—monitor lizards and peafowl are common, and leopard activity has been documented in the area, though encounters are extremely rare during daylight hours.

**Johnson & Johnson Gardens Circuit** offers a more structured, urban walking route. Starting from the gardens (officially known as Kalidas Udyan but universally called Johnson & Johnson Gardens), you can walk the garden perimeter and then loop through the surrounding Mulund West residential lanes. The circuit covers about 2.5 kilometres on flat terrain with excellent tree cover. The streets around the garden are among the best-maintained in Mulund, and the morning crowd consists almost entirely of walkers, joggers, and pet parents. This route suits dogs that prefer a predictable, low-stimulation environment with reliable surfaces.

**Nahur to Mulund East Residential Walk** serves pet parents on the eastern side. Starting from the Nahur area, head north through the residential lanes of Mulund East toward Fortis Hospital and the commercial cluster beyond. The route is about 2 kilometres one way and passes through a mix of older housing societies and newer apartment complexes. The eastern side of Mulund has fewer mature trees than the west, but the internal lanes are still quieter than the main roads. Morning walks here should wrap up before 7:30 AM, when school traffic and autorickshaws fill the streets.

## Dog-Friendly Parks and Open Spaces

**Johnson & Johnson Gardens (Kalidas Udyan)** is Mulund's flagship green space and one of the best public gardens in Mumbai's eastern suburbs. The garden is large by Mumbai standards, with a proper walking track, extensive lawns, ornamental plantings, and a canopy of mature trees that provides shade across most of the garden throughout the day. Morning hours between 5:30 and 7 AM are prime time for dog walkers, and the garden sees a regular community of pet parents. The grass is well-maintained—a rarity in Mumbai's public gardens—and provides a comfortable surface for dogs that dislike pavement. The garden has designated entry points and the surrounding wall creates a semi-enclosed environment, though it is not a fully fenced dog park.

**Mulund Gymkhana Grounds** provide a large open space for dogs that need room to move. The grounds are primarily used for sports during the day, but early morning hours are available for walkers and their pets. The surface is packed earth and grass—good natural terrain. The grounds are located in Mulund West and are easily accessible from most residential areas.

The **open spaces along the national park boundary** offer the most natural walking environment in the area. These are not formal parks but transitional zones between residential development and the park's forested hills. The ground is uneven, with natural vegetation, fallen leaves, and occasional rocky patches. Dogs that enjoy off-pavement exploration thrive here. However, these areas are not maintained—check for broken glass, metal debris, and litter before letting your dog explore, and keep them leashed at all times.

**Bhandup Complex Garden**, accessible from the Bhandup side of Mulund, is a smaller but well-maintained neighbourhood garden with a walking track and shade trees. It serves as a good alternative for pet parents who find Johnson & Johnson Gardens too crowded during peak morning hours.

## Walking Tips for Mulund

Mulund's slightly elevated position and proximity to hills give it marginally better air circulation than the fully urbanised suburbs to its south. That said, the Eastern Express Highway cuts through the area, and the roads along the highway corridor carry the same diesel exhaust concerns as anywhere else in Mumbai. Keep walks within the colony interiors and garden circuits, away from the highway.

Summer heat in Mulund is comparable to the rest of Mumbai, but the foothill routes offer a notable advantage—the tree cover on the trails approaching the national park boundary provides natural cooling that no urban footpath can match. If you have the option, prioritise the western foothill walks during March to May. On flat urban routes, test pavement temperature before every outing and carry water. For comprehensive summer safety advice, read our [summer dog walking safety guide](/blog/summer-dog-walking-safety-mumbai).

Monsoon in Mulund is a mixed experience. The well-drained colony roads in Mulund West handle normal rainfall well, and Johnson & Johnson Gardens maintains reasonable drainage. However, the foothill trails become genuinely hazardous during monsoon—wet rocks, muddy slopes, and increased snake and insect activity make these routes unsafe from June through September. Stick to the flat, paved routes during monsoon. The low-lying areas near Nahur and parts of Mulund East can waterlog after heavy downpours, so have alternative routes planned. Post-walk paw cleaning is essential—always dry between the toes and check for debris.

Mulund's proximity to the national park means the neighbourhood has a more active wildlife corridor than most Mumbai suburbs. Stray dogs in the foothill areas can be more territorial than urban strays, as they exist at the boundary between domestic and wild zones. Keep your dog leashed, maintain a calm, steady pace, and avoid the foothill trails after dark.

## Breed Recommendations for Mulund Routes

The foothill trail route is a dream for high-energy, adventure-loving breeds. Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherds, Belgian Malinois, and active Indian Pariah dogs will relish the distance, the varied terrain, and the sensory richness of the natural environment. These breeds need physical challenge and mental stimulation, and the foothill route delivers both. Ensure your dog has reliable recall before attempting the longer trail sections.

The Johnson & Johnson Gardens circuit suits medium-energy breeds beautifully—Cocker Spaniels, Beagles, Dachshunds, and mixed breeds that enjoy a solid walk without extreme exertion. The well-maintained paths and the garden's enclosed feel make it a comfortable, low-stress route.

Smaller breeds—Shih Tzus, Pomeranians, Maltese, Lhasa Apsos—do best on the flat residential lanes around the garden. The shade and moderate distance match their exercise needs, and the quiet environment prevents the overstimulation that small breeds are prone to in busier areas.

Brachycephalic breeds should stick to the earliest morning window—before 6:30 AM—on the shadiest colony roads. The national park foothills are too strenuous for these breeds, and the humidity in Mulund, while slightly less oppressive than downtown Mumbai, still poses a risk. Keep walks to 15 minutes and carry water.

Mulund's range of walking environments—from manicured gardens to foothill trails—means route selection matters more here than in most suburbs. A skilled walker matches the route to the dog, the weather, and the season. Platypus Guardians in Mulund do exactly that. They know which foothill paths are safe in dry weather, when Johnson & Johnson Gardens has the fewest crowds, which colony lanes have the deepest shade, and how to navigate the area's unique wildlife considerations.
