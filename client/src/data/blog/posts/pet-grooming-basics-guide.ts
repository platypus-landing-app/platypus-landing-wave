Grooming is not just about keeping your dog looking good—it is a fundamental part of their health and well-being. Regular grooming helps prevent skin infections, catches health issues early, and strengthens the bond between you and your pet. Whether you are a first-time dog parent or a seasoned one, understanding grooming basics will help you keep your furry companion comfortable and thriving.

## How Often Should You Bathe Your Dog?

One of the most common questions dog parents ask is how frequently they should bathe their dog. The answer depends on breed, coat type, and lifestyle. Most dogs do well with a bath every four to six weeks. Dogs with oily coats, like Basset Hounds, may need bathing more frequently, while breeds with water-repellent coats, like Golden Retrievers, benefit from less frequent baths to preserve their natural oils. If your dog spends a lot of time outdoors or rolls in mud during walks, you may need to bathe them more often. Always use a dog-specific shampoo—human shampoos can strip their skin of essential oils and cause irritation.

## Brushing: Tailored to Your Dog's Coat

Brushing is one of the most important grooming habits you can develop. It removes loose fur, prevents matting, distributes natural oils, and gives you a chance to check for lumps, ticks, or skin issues. Short-coated breeds like Beagles and Dachshunds benefit from a weekly brush with a bristle brush. Medium-coated dogs like Cocker Spaniels need brushing two to three times a week with a slicker brush. Long-coated breeds like Shih Tzus and Lhasa Apsos require daily brushing to prevent painful tangles and mats. Double-coated breeds like Huskies and German Shepherds need extra attention during shedding season, when an undercoat rake can work wonders.

## Nail Trimming: The Dreaded but Necessary Task

Many dog parents avoid nail trimming because it makes them nervous, but overgrown nails can cause pain, affect your dog's gait, and even lead to joint problems over time. Aim to trim nails every three to four weeks. Use a sharp, dog-specific nail clipper and trim a small amount at a time to avoid cutting the quick—the blood vessel inside the nail. If your dog has dark nails and you cannot see the quick, trim just the tip. A good trick is to listen for clicking sounds when your dog walks on a hard floor. If you hear it, it is time for a trim. If you are uncomfortable doing it yourself, a professional groomer or veterinarian can help.

## Ear Cleaning and Dental Hygiene

Ears and teeth are two areas that dog parents often overlook. Dogs with floppy ears, like Labradors and Cocker Spaniels, are especially prone to ear infections because moisture gets trapped inside the ear canal. Check your dog's ears weekly for redness, unusual odour, or discharge. Use a vet-recommended ear cleaning solution and a cotton ball—never insert anything deep into the ear canal.

Dental hygiene is equally critical. Poor oral health can lead to gum disease, tooth loss, and even organ damage as bacteria enters the bloodstream. Brush your dog's teeth two to three times a week using a dog-specific toothbrush and toothpaste. Dental chews and toys can supplement brushing but should not replace it entirely.

## When to See a Professional Groomer

While basic grooming can be handled at home, certain tasks are best left to professionals. Breed-specific haircuts, difficult mat removal, and anal gland expression require trained hands and specialized tools. Professional groomers can also spot skin conditions, parasites, or abnormalities that you might miss. If your dog becomes extremely anxious during grooming, a professional experienced in handling nervous dogs can make the process safer and less stressful.

## Grooming and Walks Go Hand in Hand

A well-groomed dog is a healthier, more comfortable walking companion. Regular grooming keeps paws clean, nails trimmed, and coats free of debris—all of which contribute to better, more enjoyable walks. At **Platypus**, our Guardians observe your dog's coat and paw condition during every walk and flag anything that looks unusual. We believe that comprehensive pet care means paying attention to every detail. And for those looking for even more convenience, a Platypus grooming service is coming soon—stay tuned for updates.
