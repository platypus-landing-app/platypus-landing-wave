Andheri is Mumbai's largest suburb by population and, perhaps surprisingly, one of its better areas for dog walking. The neighbourhood stretches from the Versova coastline in the west to the Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road in the east, encompassing everything from quiet residential complexes to bustling commercial zones. What makes Andheri work for pet parents is its sheer variety. Within a fifteen-minute radius, you can walk your dog along a beach, through a manicured garden, or on a quiet residential road with mature trees providing overhead shade.

The neighbourhood is broadly divided into Andheri West and Andheri East, and the dog walking experience differs considerably between the two. Andheri West, particularly the Lokhandwala, Versova, and Oshiwara belts, benefits from proximity to the coast and a higher density of parks and open spaces. Andheri East, anchored by the MIDC and Chakala areas, is more industrial, but pockets around Marol and the Saki Naka residential clusters offer functional walking corridors that work well during off-peak hours.

## Best Dog Walking Routes in Andheri

**Lokhandwala Complex and Back Road** is the most popular dog walking circuit in Andheri West. The internal roads of Lokhandwala Complex are relatively wide, tree-lined, and see minimal through traffic during early morning and late evening hours. The loop from the main Lokhandwala gate, past the garden on the backside, and returning via the Four Bungalows Road stretch covers roughly 2.5 kilometres—enough for a solid morning walk. The terrain is flat and paved, suitable for all breeds. Many pet parents here walk in informal groups, so it doubles as a socialisation opportunity for dogs that enjoy canine company.

**Versova Beach to Gilbert Hill stretch** offers a more adventurous route. Starting at the Versova beachfront, you can walk south along the sand (ideal before 7 AM when fishermen are launching boats but foot traffic is minimal), then loop inland toward the Gilbert Hill area. The terrain shifts from soft sand to paved roads, giving your dog a varied sensory and physical experience. The sand portion is demanding on the legs, making this route excellent for high-energy breeds that need extra exertion. Versova Beach is noticeably quieter than Juhu, which works in favour of dogs that get overwhelmed by crowds. For more on the Versova area specifically, see our [Versova dog walking guide](/blog/dog-walking-guide-versova).

**Oshiwara Garden Circuit** is Andheri's best option for a green, contained walk. The garden near Oshiwara has a perimeter walking track, grassy areas, and benches. While not large, the circuit is well-maintained, and the morning crowd (6 to 8 AM) is predominantly dog walkers and joggers. The enclosed nature of the space makes it practical for training sessions and for dogs still building recall skills. The neighbouring residential lanes extending toward Lokhandwala are quiet enough to extend the walk if your dog needs more distance.

## Dog-Friendly Parks and Open Spaces

**Jogeshwari Garden** (near Jogeshwari station, West) is one of the more spacious green areas accessible from Andheri. The garden has a jogging track, some open grassy sections, and mature shade trees. Dogs are common here during morning hours, and the atmosphere is relaxed. It is about a ten-minute drive from central Andheri West, making it a good weekend option for dogs that benefit from new environments.

**DN Nagar Garden** near the Metro station in Andheri West is compact but well-visited by pet parents. The paved track and small grassy patches provide a reliable daily option for dogs living in the dense apartment clusters of the DN Nagar and Azad Nagar areas. It tends to get crowded by 7:30 AM, so arriving earlier is advisable.

The **Four Bungalows area** does not have a formal park, but the residential lanes off the main road are some of the widest and quietest in Andheri West. The plots here are larger, gardens spill over compound walls providing shade, and vehicular traffic is sparse before 8 AM. Many pet parents in this micro-neighbourhood treat these lanes as their de facto dog walking park.

For a more immersive experience, **Aarey Colony** is accessible from Andheri East via the Aarey Road entrance. The forest trails and dairy land here offer a completely different walking environment—unpaved, shaded, and rich in natural scents that dogs find endlessly engaging. Weekday mornings are best for avoiding crowds. Stay on established paths and keep your dog leashed, as the area borders leopard territory.

## Walking Tips for Andheri

Andheri's inland streets heat up faster and cool down slower than the coastal stretches. Between March and May, pavement temperatures on roads away from the Versova breeze can be punishing. Schedule walks before 6:30 AM or after 7 PM during summer. For heat safety details, refer to our [summer walking safety guide](/blog/summer-dog-walking-safety-mumbai).

Monsoon management in Andheri requires route awareness. The Oshiwara nullah area and the low-lying stretches near SV Road and Link Road waterlog heavily during sustained rainfall. Lokhandwala Complex's internal roads drain reasonably well, making them the safer monsoon option. Versova Beach should be avoided entirely during monsoon—the tides become unpredictable and debris washes ashore. Stick to elevated residential lanes and check our [monsoon safety tips](/blog/dog-walking-safety-tips-mumbai-monsoon) for a complete wet-weather protocol.

Traffic is Andheri's primary hazard for dog walkers. The main arteries—SV Road, Link Road, and New Link Road—carry aggressive traffic at most hours. Avoid walking dogs on these roads regardless of the time. Instead, use internal colony roads and residential back lanes, where vehicle speeds are lower and pavements (where they exist) offer some buffer from traffic.

## Breed Recommendations for Andheri Routes

The Versova Beach sand walk is ideal for Labradors, German Shepherds, Dalmatians, and other athletic breeds that need serious cardio. The sand resistance provides a workout that flat road walking simply cannot match—twenty minutes on sand is equivalent to significantly more on pavement.

Lokhandwala's flat, paved loop suits medium-energy breeds like Cocker Spaniels, Beagles, and Indie dogs. The distance is manageable, the terrain is gentle, and the social environment (other dogs are almost guaranteed during morning hours) adds enrichment value. Smaller breeds like Pomeranians and Lhasa Apsos do well in the Oshiwara Garden circuit, where the contained space and softer ground are gentler on small joints.

For brachycephalic breeds in Andheri, the Versova seafront early morning window (before 6:30 AM) is your best bet. The sea breeze compensates partially for the breed's compromised cooling ability. Avoid the inland routes on warm days entirely with these breeds.

## Professional Dog Walking in Andheri with Platypus

Andheri's size and diversity make it a neighbourhood where local knowledge is genuinely valuable. A Guardian who knows that the Four Bungalows lanes clear out by 6:15 AM, that the Oshiwara Garden gate opens at 5:30, or that the Versova tide recedes enough for safe beach walking by 6 AM can make the difference between an average walk and an excellent one.

Platypus Guardians in Andheri are matched to your specific micro-neighbourhood. They carry water, waste bags, and treats, and every walk includes GPS tracking and post-walk reports with photos. Routes are adjusted daily based on weather and your dog's condition.
