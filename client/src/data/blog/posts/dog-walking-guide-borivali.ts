Borivali holds a rare distinction among Mumbai suburbs: it borders an actual national park. Sanjay Gandhi National Park covers over 100 square kilometres of forest on Borivali's eastern flank, which means that pet parents here have access to walking environments that simply do not exist anywhere else in the city. The suburb itself, both east and west, also offers a mix of residential calm, old village character, and green open spaces that make daily dog walks genuinely enjoyable rather than a chore squeezed between traffic.

IC Colony on the western side retains the feel of a small town, with bungalows, churches, and lanes where everyone seems to know everyone. Borivali East, closer to the national park entrance, gives you proximity to nature trails and the quieter foothills. Shimpoli, tucked between Borivali and Goregaon, has its own residential rhythm. Together, these neighbourhoods form one of the most dog-friendly pockets in all of Mumbai.

## Best Dog Walking Routes in Borivali

### Sanjay Gandhi National Park Periphery Trail

The most distinctive walking experience in Borivali is along the periphery of Sanjay Gandhi National Park. To be clear, dogs are not permitted inside the main park gates. However, the roads and paths leading to the park entrance, as well as the trails along the park's outer boundary, offer a fantastic walking environment. The approach road from Borivali East station toward the main gate is tree-lined, relatively vehicle-free in the early morning, and feels more like a hill-station road than something in Mumbai.

The best time is between 5:30 and 7:30 AM. The air is noticeably cooler and cleaner than elsewhere in the city, the canopy cover provides shade, and the sounds of birds replace the usual traffic noise. The walk from the station area to the park entrance and back covers about 4 kilometres. For shorter walks, turn around at the halfway mark near the Film City junction. The terrain is paved but has gentle inclines, making it excellent for dogs that need cardiovascular exercise without the impact of running on flat ground.

Watch for monkeys, especially near the park entrance. They are accustomed to humans but can be unpredictable around dogs. Keep your dog on a short leash through this stretch and avoid carrying exposed food.

### IC Colony Loop

IC Colony (Immaculate Conception Colony) in Borivali West is one of the most pleasant residential walking areas in the western suburbs. The colony is laid out in a grid of lanes with low-rise bungalows, small gardens, and an abundance of mature trees. Vehicle traffic is light, particularly before 8 AM, and the streets have a quiet, community feel that dogs respond to positively.

A full loop through the main IC Colony lanes covers about 2 kilometres and takes 30 to 40 minutes at a relaxed pace. The terrain is entirely flat and paved, suitable for dogs of all ages and sizes. The colony has a few small parks and open plots where pet parents gather informally for morning socialisation. St. Joseph's Church and the lanes around it form the social centre of the colony, and you will find other dog walkers here most mornings.

This is an ideal route for senior dogs, puppies on their first neighbourhood walks, and breeds that overheat easily. The tree cover keeps temperatures manageable well into the morning.

### Shimpoli Road and Carter Road No. 6

The Shimpoli area, on the southern edge of Borivali West, has a quieter residential character than the main Borivali stretch. The internal roads near Carter Road No. 6 (not to be confused with the famous Carter Road in Bandra) are wider than typical Mumbai lanes, with some lined by old residential bungalows and others by newer apartment complexes. The walk from Shimpoli junction through the internal roads and toward the Borivali West main road covers about 2 kilometres.

This route is good for dogs that need a moderate-length walk without too much stimulation. The streets are calm in the morning, and the mix of old and new construction provides varied smells and sights that keep dogs mentally engaged. On weekday mornings, you can complete the entire loop without encountering heavy traffic.

## Dog-Friendly Parks and Open Spaces

The Sanjay Gandhi National Park nature information centre area, just outside the main gates, has a small open lawn where dogs are sometimes walked. This is not officially designated for dogs, but the space is used informally by local pet parents, especially on weekday mornings when visitor traffic is low.

The garden near Borivali West station, known locally as the Mandapeshwar garden, is a compact green space with benches, some shade, and a paved walking path. It gets busy with morning walkers, so the 6:00 to 7:00 AM window works best for dogs. The space is not large enough for off-leash play but serves well for structured on-leash walks and brief socialisation.

IC Colony has several pocket gardens and open plots scattered through the lanes. These informal spaces are where the colony's dog parents have built a community. The open ground near the colony's main playground is the most popular gathering spot and is large enough for gentle off-leash play with well-socialised dogs.

For a beach experience, Gorai Beach is accessible from Borivali via a short ferry ride from Gorai Creek. The beach is less commercial than Juhu or Versova and offers wide stretches of sand during low tide. It is a worthwhile weekend outing rather than a daily walk, but dogs that love water and sand will find it deeply satisfying.

## Walking Tips for Borivali

**The national park approach road has wildlife.** Monkeys, peacocks, and occasionally deer are spotted near the park boundary. Keep your dog leashed at all times and do not let them chase wildlife. This is both a safety issue and a legal one, as the area falls under forest department jurisdiction.

**Monsoon transforms the terrain.** The foothills and park periphery become lush and beautiful during monsoon but also slippery and potentially hazardous. Leeches are common on the trails from June to September. Stick to paved routes during the rainy months and check our [monsoon safety tips](/blog/dog-walking-safety-tips-mumbai-monsoon) for detailed guidance.

**Carry tick prevention.** Borivali's proximity to forest means tick exposure is higher here than in most Mumbai suburbs. Ensure your dog is on regular tick and flea prevention, and check their coat thoroughly after walks near the national park periphery.

**Morning is king.** By 9 AM, even the quieter Borivali routes start seeing school and office traffic. The 5:30 to 7:30 AM window is consistently the best across all routes in the area.

## Breed Recommendations for Borivali Routes

The national park periphery trail is ideal for high-energy, athletic breeds. German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers, Dobermans, and fit Indian Pariah dogs will thrive on the inclines and the 4-kilometre distance. Breeds with strong prey drives, such as Huskies and Beagles, should be on a secure harness and short leash given the wildlife in the area.

IC Colony suits every breed. Small dogs like Pomeranians, Maltese, and Lhasa Apsos enjoy the gentle pace. Medium breeds like Cocker Spaniels and Beagles appreciate the socialisation opportunities. Senior dogs of any breed can walk comfortably on the flat, shaded lanes.

Brachycephalic breeds (Pugs, Bulldogs, Shih Tzus) should avoid the national park route, especially in warmer months. The inclines and distance can push their respiratory system beyond comfort. Stick to IC Colony or the flat Shimpoli roads for these breeds, and walk only during the coolest hours. For summer-specific precautions, review our [summer walking safety guide](/blog/summer-dog-walking-safety-mumbai).

## Professional Dog Walking in Borivali with Platypus

Borivali's unique position next to a national park creates walking opportunities that most Mumbai neighbourhoods simply cannot match. But it also demands local knowledge: which trails are safe on a given day, where monkeys are congregating, which garden is too crowded at a particular hour. Our Platypus Guardians in Borivali bring that knowledge to every walk. They are certified, GPS-tracked, and trained to handle the specific conditions of this area, from wildlife encounters to monsoon terrain.

If you live in Borivali West, Borivali East, IC Colony, or Shimpoli, book a [professional dog walking in Borivali](/dog-walking/borivali) trial walk at Rs. 199. Let a local Guardian give your dog the kind of walk that makes the most of everything this neighbourhood has to offer.
